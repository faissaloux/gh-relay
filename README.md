Adding a contractor or auditor as a GitHub collaborator means IT tickets, legal paperwork, a paid seat, and a permission that lingers long after the review is done. Most teams end up emailing zip files or screensharing instead, both worse.

**gh-relay** fixes this in one command. Run it on your machine, share a temporary URL, and your guest gets a read-only browser view of the codebase. When you press `Ctrl+C`, the link is dead, zero cleanup, zero lingering access.

```
$ export GH_RELAY_TOKEN=ghp_...
$ gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app --expire 1h

   Token valid
   Repository: my-org/private-app (private)
   Found 12 branch(es)
   Tunnel active

    Share this URL with your guest:
    https://shiny-apple-92.trycloudflare.com

    Session expires in: 1h
  Press Ctrl+C to end the session immediately.
```

```

1. **You run** `gh-relay share` with your GitHub token and repo name.
2. **A local proxy** starts on your machine and fetches files from GitHub using your token.
3. **A secure tunnel** (Cloudflare or ngrok) exposes the proxy via a temporary public URL.
4. **Your guest opens the URL** and gets a read-only file browser. Optionally protect with a passcode.
5. **You press `Ctrl+C`** (or `--expire` elapses) and the tunnel closes instantly. The URL is dead.
Your PAT never leaves your machine. The guest can't push, clone, or access anything you didn't share.

---

## Usage

### Using environment variable

```bash
export GH_RELAY_TOKEN=ghp_YourPersonalAccessToken
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app --expire 1h
```

If both `--token` and `GH_RELAY_TOKEN` are set, `--token` takes precedence (a warning is logged).

> **Tip:** Avoid exposing your token in shell history by using `GH_RELAY_TOKEN` instead of `--token`.

### Share a repo

```bash
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app
```

### Set an expiry

```bash
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app --expire 30m
```
  --expire 30m
```

### Share a specific branch

```bash
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app --branch feature/new-auth
```

### Share only selected paths

Use `--allow` to expose only matching repository paths. Use `--deny` to hide matching paths; deny rules always take precedence over allow rules.

```bash
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app --allow "src/**,docs/**,README.md"
```

```bash
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app --allow "src/**,docs/**,README.md" --deny ".env,.env.*,secrets/**,*.pem"
```

Filters are enforced server-side for both `/api/tree` listings and `/api/blob` file access, so a guest cannot bypass a hidden path by manually requesting a blob SHA. Patterns are globs; use `.env,.env.*` if you want to hide both `.env` and files like `.env.local`.

### Use ngrok instead of Cloudflare

```bash
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app --tunnel ngrok
```

### Local only (no tunnel, useful for testing)

```bash
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app --tunnel none --port 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

### Require an access code

Use `--passcode` to protect the shared URL with a short code. gh-relay prints the URL and access code separately; the guest must enter the code before the repository browser loads.

```bash
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app --passcode
```

You can also choose the code yourself. Explicit values must use `--passcode=value`, must be 8-128 characters, and cannot be `true` or `false`. Prefer generated codes when possible so the access code does not land in shell history or process listings.

```bash
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app --passcode=review-483920
```

The access code helps if a URL is accidentally forwarded. It is still a shared secret; anyone with both the URL and code can open the session until it expires or you stop gh-relay.

### Pre-share secret warnings

Before a share session starts, gh-relay scans the selected branch's shareable repository tree for sensitive-looking paths such as `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, `secrets/`, `credentials.yml`, `config/credentials.yml`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `kubeconfig`, `.npmrc`, `.pypirc`, and `terraform.tfvars`. If `--allow` or `--deny` is set, those filters are applied before the warning scan.

Path scanning is enabled by default:

```bash
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app
```

You can also scan small text files for common high-risk patterns such as AWS access key IDs, GitHub token prefixes, private key headers, and simple assignments like `password=`, `secret=`, `api_key=`, or `token=`:

```bash
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app --scan-content
```

If findings are detected, gh-relay prints only the file path, finding type, severity, and rule name. It never prints matched secret values.

```text
⚠️  Potential sensitive files or secrets detected before sharing:

HIGH    path     .env                         matched rule: dotenv file
HIGH    path     deploy/prod.pem              matched rule: private key/certificate file
MEDIUM  content  config/settings.yml          matched rule: generic token assignment

gh-relay does not print secret values. Review these files before exposing this repo.

Continue sharing? [y/N]:
```

In non-interactive mode, gh-relay prints the warning and continues unless `--fail-on-secrets` is set:

```bash
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app --fail-on-secrets
```

To skip this preflight scan:

```bash
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app --no-scan-secrets
```

This is a best-effort warning system, not a full security scanner. It does not scan Git history, all branches, generated artifacts outside the selected tree, large blobs, binary files, encrypted files, or every possible secret format. Review sensitive repositories before exposing them.

### Enable audit logging

```bash
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app --audit
```

Logs guest activity to the terminal and prints a summary on exit:

```
[audit] Guest viewed: src/main.go (from 105.190.183.127)
[audit] GET /api/commits (from 105.190.183.127)

  SESSION AUDIT SUMMARY
  Files viewed  : 5 (3 unique)
  Total requests: 12
  Unique IPs    : 1
  Duration      : 4m32s
```

### Allow guests to download as ZIP

```bash
gh-relay share --repo my-org/private-app --allow-download
```

A "Download ZIP" button appears in the guest's browser. The ZIP is streamed directly from GitHub through the proxy — nothing is written to disk. Off by default since a downloaded ZIP gives the guest a permanent copy.

### All flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--token` | *(optional if `GH_RELAY_TOKEN` is set)* | GitHub PAT with `repo` scope, or set via `GH_RELAY_TOKEN` env var. [Generate one here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo). |
| `--repo` | *(required)* | Target repository in `owner/repo` format |
| `--branch` | `main` | Branch to share |
| `--port` | `8080` | Local port for the proxy server |
| `--expire` | unlimited | Auto-close after this duration (`30m`, `1h`, `2h30m`) |
| `--passcode` | disabled | Require a guest access code; use `--passcode` to generate one or `--passcode=value` to set one |
| `--tunnel` | `cloudflare` | Tunnel provider: `cloudflare`, `ngrok`, or `none` |
| `--allow` | empty | Comma-separated repository-relative path patterns to include |
| `--deny` | empty | Comma-separated repository-relative path patterns to exclude; deny rules win |
| `--scan-secrets` | `true` | Scan repository paths for sensitive files before sharing |
| `--no-scan-secrets` | `false` | Disable pre-share sensitive file scanning |
| `--scan-content` | `false` | Also scan small text blobs for common secret patterns |
| `--fail-on-secrets` | `false` | Exit non-zero if the pre-share scan finds potential secrets |
| `--audit` | `false` | Log guest activity and print a session summary on exit |
| `--allow-download` | `false` | Allow guests to download the repository as a ZIP archive |

## Security

gh-relay is designed from the ground up to share as little as possible.

| Property | How it's enforced |
|---|---|
| **Token never leaves your machine** | All GitHub API calls are made server-side. The guest only receives a short-lived relay token. |
| **Read-only by design** | The proxy only registers `GET` handlers. `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` return `405` before any session check. |
| **Optional access code** | `--passcode` keeps the file browser locked until the guest enters the shared code. Failed unlock attempts are rate-limited per client IP. |
| **Server-side path filters** | Optional `--allow` and `--deny` rules are applied to tree listings and blob reads. Deny rules take precedence and blob requests must match the allowed path, branch, and SHA. |
| **Pre-share secret warning** | Before opening the tunnel, gh-relay scans the filtered shareable tree for suspicious paths and can optionally scan small text blobs. Findings are sanitized and never include matched secret values. |
| **Nothing written to disk** | Files are fetched on demand and streamed directly to the guest. No `git clone`, no temp files. |
| **Instant teardown** | `Ctrl+C` or `--expire` kills the tunnel, shuts the server, and invalidates all session cookies simultaneously. |
| **No external dependencies in the browser** | The file browser SPA is fully self-contained. No third-party scripts, no CDN calls from the guest's browser. |
| **Zero trust** | The guest can only see what you share. They can't navigate to other repos, access your GitHub account, or do anything outside the API calls you allow. |
| **No dependencies on third-party services** | The core functionality relies only on GitHub and your chosen tunnel provider. No analytics, no databases, no external APIs. |

### GitHub token scopes

For **fine-grained PATs** (recommended):
- `Contents: Read-only`
- `Metadata: Read-only`

For **classic PATs**:
- `repo` | for private repositories
- `public_repo` | for public repositories only

> **Tip:** Create a dedicated PAT for gh-relay sessions with the minimum required scopes and a short expiry matching your longest expected review session.
>
> **Quick start:** Generate a classic PAT with `repo` scope at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo

---

## Guest experience

The guest opens the URL in any browser, no GitHub account, no sign-in, no extension required. If `--passcode` is enabled, they enter the access code first. They see:

- A **file tree** with folder expand/collapse and a live filter
- A **code viewer** with line numbers for text files
- A **branch switcher** to explore other branches
- A **commit history** panel showing recent commits on the active branch

They cannot clone, push, download a zip, or navigate outside the repository you shared.
